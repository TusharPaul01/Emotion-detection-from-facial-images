**Image Classification with TensorFlow/Keras**
This repository contains code for training a deep learning model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.

Overview
In this project, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. We'll follow these steps:

Dataset Preparation: Gather and organize the image dataset. Ensure that images are labeled and stored in separate directories for each class.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the images, including resizing, rescaling, and augmentation if necessary. Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Model Building: Define and compile a CNN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras. Adjust the model architecture, layers, and hyperparameters as needed.

Model Training: Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset. Monitor the training process and adjust parameters if necessary to improve performance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to assess its performance in terms of accuracy and loss.

Inference: Test the trained model on new, unseen images to classify them into respective categories.
